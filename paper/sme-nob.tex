\achapter{apertium-sme-nob:using an HFST lexicon in a long-distance RBMT system}{The Author}


  
    % \begin{abstract}
    We describe the development of a rule-based machine translation
    system from Northern S치mi to Norwegian Bokm친l built on a
    combination of Free and Open Source resources: the Apertium
    platform and the Giellatekno HFST lexicon and Constraint Grammar
    disambiguator.
    \comment{more}
    We detail the integration of these and other resources in the
    system along with the construction of the lexical and structural
    transfer, and evaluate the translation quality in comparison with
    another system. Finally, some future work is suggested.

\section{Introduction}
Northern S치mi (sme) is an Uralic language spoken by about 20,000
people in the northern parts of Norway, Sweden and Finland. Norwegian
Bokm친l (nob) is a North Germanic language with about 4.5 speakers,
mostly in Norway.

Most sme speakers in Norway understand nob, while most nob speakers do
not understand sme. The languages are completely unrelated, and the
linguistic distance is great, making it hard to achieve high quality.
A nob$\rightarrow{}$sme system would only be useful if the quality
were good enough that it could be used for text production
(post-editing). On the other hand, a sme$\rightarrow{}$nob
gisting-quality system can be useful for the large group of nob
speakers who don't understand sme. Thus we chose to focus on the
sme$\rightarrow{}$nob direction first.

\subsection{Gisting eval}
\comment{The idea here is that if the user can select the right
  alternative, she must have some comprehension of the meaning. Now,
  the sentence might have errors such that both the 'right'
  alternative and the context are wrong in the same way, but if errors
  are random enough, and the words that are translated within a
  sentence are never consistently skewed towards the same wrong
  meaning, selecting the right alternative will be a sign of
  comprehending the meaning.}
