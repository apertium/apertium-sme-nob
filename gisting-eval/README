# Assuming apache runs as the user www-data:
$ sudo mkdir /srv/http/poormansdb
$ sudo chown www-data /srv/http/poormansdb
$ sudo chgrp www-data /srv/http/poormansdb

# Note: if you don't keep www-stuff in /srv/http, you have to change
# the directory in each of the index.php files! Look for the string
# `file_put_contents'.

# then, from this directory:
$ make

# Assuming /var/www is where you keep your web pages:
$ ln -s `pwd` /var/www/gisting-eval

# or copy it over, or put it in ~/public_html
