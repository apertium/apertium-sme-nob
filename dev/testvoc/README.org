The most useful command here is probably

$ dev/testvoc/sme-bidix-sanity.sh

which just compares the analyser with the bidix.


There is also a more complete testvoc script for the generator:

$ dev/testvoc/generation.sh --hfst sme-nob > testvoc.out

It needs at least 1G of RAM, takes hours on a fast laptop, and the
output can end up pretty big (so remember to redirect output to a
file).
