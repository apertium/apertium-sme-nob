The parallell text here is gathered from kongehuset.no, norga.no,
dubestemmer.no and kommune.no, and should thus be in the public
domain.

Note: when WER-testing, the reference translation should ideally be a
post-edit of the MT output with the source text as a guide, only
containing the changes needed before publication. This does not hold
for the translations here. (Of course, the fact that these files are
used to inform development will also skew any test results.)
