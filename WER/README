The parallell text here is gathered from kongehuset.no, norga.no and
kommune.no, and should thus be in the public domain.

Note: when WER-testing, the reference translation should ideally be a
post-edit of the MT output with the source text as a guide, only
containing the changes needed before publication. This does not hold
for the translations here.
