== Compilation ==

This lexicon trimmer needs a little compilation first:

    $ sh autogen.sh
    $ make

(Don't "make install". I'm not sure what that will do.) As long as
lttoolbox is installed correctly according to
http://wiki.apertium.org/wiki/Minimal_installation_from_SVN, this
should work just fine. You may have to do

    $ PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$PREFIX/lib/pkgconfig sh autogen.sh
    $ make

if you installed lttoolbox in some strange $PREFIX.


== Usage ==

To update the SÃ¡mi morphology, first make your private langs.cfg file
if you haven't already:

    $ cp langs.cfg.in langs.cfg
    $ edit langs.cfg

and make sure to change "SRC" to point to the sme src directory in
giellatekno, probably something like
"/home/username/giellatekno-svn/trunk/gt/sme/src/". The "OUTPUT_DIR"
should point to your apertium-sme-nob directory (if you're running the
script from this sub-directory of apertium-sme-nob, "../" should
work). 

Then, make sure ../sme-nob.autobil.bin is compiled and run:

    $ python2 ./update-lexc.py --config=langs.cfg

(perhaps exchanging python2 for python2.6 or whatever python2 version
you have)


If you don't want to trim the lexicon down to the bidix, you can use
the notrim-langs.cfg.in file as your basis (it will still strip a lot
of stuff that causes errors, but keep the lexicon large).


== TODO ==

* maybe move this into trunk/apertium-tools/apertium-hfst-tools if it
  becomes generally useful, as it's a lot less painful than using the
  lt-expand method
