==Monodix==

SME:

* The monodix is a subset of the GT sme transducer. 
** The file apertium-sme-smj.sme.twol should be kept up to date with twol-sme.txt
** The file apertium-sme-smj.sme.lexc should be kept up to date using 
   the dev/update-lexc.sh script

NOB: 

* The monodix should probably be kept up to date with the 
  one in apertium-nn-nb
